### Hello, I'm Mirko Sertic 👋

I'm a Software Engineer and Consultant specializing in enterprise software architecture and development.

#### What I Do

I provide software development and consulting services in the field of electronic data processing. As a consultant and software craftsman, I've supported major companies across Germany and Switzerland on projects ranging from small initiatives to large-scale enterprise systems. 

My experience spans both hands-on development and software architecture, enabling me to make informed technical decisions, design sustainable architectures, and ensure reliable operation of complex software systems.
